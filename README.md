## Introduction

The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) is an industry taxonomy developed in 1999 by MSCI and 
Standard & Poor's (S&P) for use by the global financial community. The GICS structure consists of 11 sectors, 
24 industry groups, 69 industries and 158 sub-industries into which S&P has categorized all major public companies. 
The system is similar to ICB (Industry Classification Benchmark), a classification structure maintained by FTSE Group.

GICS is used as a basis for S&P and MSCI financial market indexes in which each company is assigned to a sub-industry, 
and to an industry, industry group, and sector, by its principal business activity. "GICS" is a registered trademark 
of McGraw Hill Financial and MSCI Inc.
